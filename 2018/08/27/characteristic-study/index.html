    <p>What is empirical study? or characteristic study? It is a way of gaining knowledge by observations (empirical evidence) <strong>qualitatively or quantitatively</strong>. With collected evidence (data), empirical questions should be answered.</p>
<p>I read four papers of characteristic study papers in a few days, which covers from concurrency bugs[1], incorrect bug fixes[2], configuration errors[3, 4, 6], and log practices[5]. These excellent study papers cover different research themes and share something for common. Here are some notes.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>All these studies are done with a specific perspective. </p>
<p> It is not just the interesting/important topic, but also the findings with a special angle to look at. [1] for concurrency bugs with bug patterns, fix strategies, and manifestation method. [2] for quantitive analysis on significance, types, patterns, reasons of incorrect fixes. [3, 4, 6] are from different perspect of configurations. [3] looks at importance, types, reactions and cause of misconfig. [4] is more about number of configuration settings, and the percentage of parameters being userd well. Based on the findings to propose that we should simplify config and improve config navigation method. [6] focus on latent config errors. [5] is all about log practices, and one interesting finding that log is modified more than other code, which give insights on improving logging practices.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Structure</p>
<p> Intro - Methodology - Perspect 1-N - Related work - Conclution</p>
<p> First, be clear what is the problem/overall topic. It should have a strong focus. </p>
<p> Then think about (0) significance or prevalence of this problem (1) causes/reasons for this problem, (2) types/categories of this problem, (3) characteristic for different types, (4) possible solutions discussion, can be simple to demostrate why the findings beneficial.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>Angles for permissions<br> Goal: provide insights for developers, users, policy makers! not a single app company.</p>
<p> What is the problem?</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorrect permission usage by developers, how many developers require too many permissions.<ul>
<li>How to define permissions developers should not ask for?<ul>
<li>Permissions that is not relevant with user required functionality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What if it is an app with various functions, how to derermine? If it is done by human determinination, how to do it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Incorrect permission understanding android users, they do not understand current permission design. fine-grained vs coarse grained</p>
<p>Small perspects</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>game apps tend to require more permissions, and users less care about it.<ul>
<li>specify the number of dangerous permissions required by each app</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the more famous the app is, the less careful people are about the permissions<ul>
<li>relationship between number of downloads to permission granting portion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

- user - app - permission - grant/not 
- app - category - permission
