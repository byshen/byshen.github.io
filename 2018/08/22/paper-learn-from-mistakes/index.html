    <p>What makes good characteristic study paper? Interesting findings with practical <strong>implications</strong> for users/developers/policy makers.</p>

What problem does the paper address?</h4><p>Real world statistics to show current study on concurrent concurrency bugs is not enough, or can not cover very important perspects. </p>
<p>13 findings in Table 1, only select intesting ones here.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>bug patterns</strong>: <em>order violations</em> bugs are important but not well studied. Atomicity violations and race conditions are also important. (By showing the numbers or portion.)</li>
<li><strong>manifestation</strong>: 1. certain partial order between 2 threads make most concurrent bugs appear. 2. concurrent access to <em>multiple variables</em> are important and not studied, probably because it’s hard. </li>
<li><strong>bug fix stategies</strong>: 1. fix deadlock bugs may introduce new non-deadlock but concurrency bugs.</li>
<li><strong>bug avoidance</strong>: for language designers, basically Transactional memory designers. <em>order</em> should also be considered to enforce checking.</li>
</ul>

How is it different from previous work, if any?"></a>2. How is it different from previous work, if any?</h4><p>Even though many works on bug study has been done, but this one stress on concurrency bugs. To see why cc bugs are different, this one is a must read.</p>
<h4 id="3-What-is-the-approach-used-to-solve-the-problem"><a href="#3-What-is-the-approach-used-to-solve-the-problem" class="headerlink" title="3. What is the approach used to solve the problem?"></a>3. What is the approach used to solve the problem?</h4><p>Section2 Methodology part specifies (1) bug sources and why these many bugs covers many software systems (2) categories and dimensions of study, specified in Table 2. (3) Threats to validity, frankly tell readers why it is limited. It makes reviewers stupid to point it out in reviews.</p>

<li>Show findings and implications in Table 1., really impressive.</li>
<li>Very clear perspectives, insightful for users</li>

<li>yes, that’s why it gets so many citations.</li>
